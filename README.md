# README for groov EPIC Secure Shell (SSH) Demo

To get secure shell access to your _groov_ EPIC processor, first get a free shell license key by contacting Preferred Customer Specialists at pcs@opto22.com, then go to [manage.groov.com](manage.groov.com), select the PR-1 you want to apply the shell access key to, and then download the license file for that device.<br>
After you have the file, go to the _groov_ Manage **System** menu in a web browser, select **License** > **Upload License**, and upload the file you downloaded from manage.groov. Next, you create a shell user through the **System** > **Shell** menu, which will also open port 22 for remote access.

To access your _groov_ EPIC using SSH over Windows use the [PuTTY SSH client](https://www.putty.org/).<br>
After the client is installed, put your hostname into the connection destination, with the default port **22** and **SSH** connection type, then click `Open`. ___You will need to trust the new connection by saying yes to the warning that pops up___, and log in with the user you created in _groov_ Manage, then you're good to go!

--------

To get this entire folder onto your _groov_ EPIC run the following command in the folder you want to download it to:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/optodeveloper/SSH-Demo.git`

See that the folder was downloaded to your current directory by doing a *list* command:<br>
`ls`

Then navigate into the new folder with:<br>
`cd SSH-Demo`

And to view the files:<br>
`ls`

### Command line tips

1. When typing a command, for example `python mmpgetuptime.py`, you can use the `tab` key to **auto-complete** the filename up to where it is unique:
    Typing `python mmpg` then pressing `tab` will autocomplete the filename, then you can just press `enter` to run the script.
    If it does not auto complete then you either need to give it more characters, or you've made a typeo and that file does not exist.

2. You can **cancel** a script with `ctrl + c`. This is useful if a script is stuck attempting to complete in the case of a network glitch or incorrect setting.

3. **Note:** These scripts will attempt to overwrite anything else running on the controller â€” including any active strategies or projects! So if your EPIC is using channel 1 on module 0 in a strategy, then you should avoid writing to that channel using these scripts and choose something unmapped instead.

## OptoMMP: Python Scripts

The following Python scripts use OptoMMP thru the socket interface to communicate *groov* EPIC, and don't require any prior setup:

*"mmpgetuptime"* returns the uptime (ms) of the controller: one optional parameter for host.
* `python mmpgetuptime.py`    will default to localhost.
* `python mmpgetuptime.py <hostname or IP address>`    will get the given host's uptime.

*"mmpreaddigmodch"* returns the state of the given module and channel: two required parameters for module and channel number.
* `python mmpreaddigmodch.py 0 1`    will read the digital state of localhost module 0, channel 1, and output the result.

*"mmpwritedigmodch0or1"* sets the state of the given module and channel: three required parameters for module number, channel number, and state 1 or 0
* `python mmpwritedigmodch0or1.py 0 1 1`    will write the digital state of localhost module 0, channel 1 to be = 1 (on/true) and attempt confirmation.


--------

## OptoMMP: Executable file compiled from C++ code

*"pulseprogram"* Flashes output 22 on module 0 twenty two times. Source code is **pulseprogram.cpp**, uses the OptoMMP C++ SDK.
* `./pulseprogram` to run the program.


--------

## REST API: Python Scripts

The following Python Scripts use RESTful APIs thru the requests package to communicate with *groov* EPIC.

### NOTE: Updating API KEY
Before using any of the following RESTful scripts you will need to install Python-pip, the Python HTTP *requests* package, **and** update the API key in the `apiKey.py` file.

**To install the requests package on *groov* EPIC:**
1. `sudo apt-get update`<br>
  Updates the *apt* (Advanced Package Tool) source list to get the latest packages.
2. `sudo apt-get install python-pip`<br>
  Installs *pip*, the Python package manager, using *apt*.
3. `sudo pip install requests`<br>
  Use the pip package manager to get the Python HTTP *requests* package.

**To get and update the API key:**
1. In the shell type `nano apiKey.py` exactly, make sure there's a capital **K** and leave the rest lowercase. Leave this text editor open.<br>TIP: Type `nano api` and then push the `tab` key and it will auto complete the file name.
2. In a browser go to https://hostname/manage, replacing "hostname" with your device's unique hostname.
3. Select **Accounts** from the main menu.
4. Select or create an account with Admin permissions.
5. Copy the long string under **API Key** at the bottom of the page, it will look like "`M7FjTXTepYhQnc9fFViTP3S3pY5GcwYP`".
6. Go back to the shell and replace the `key` variable string value with the key from the Admin user, *just using arrow keys* (left clicking with your mouse will not work) go to the end of the key and backspace to remove the old string.
7. With the cursor in between the completely empty quotes `apiKey = ''`, right click anywhere on the PuTTY screen to paste the copied API key into PuTTY.
8. The only thing on the screen should be `apiKey = 'M7FjTXTepYhQnc9fFViTP3S3pY5GcwYP'` with the text matching your own API key.
9. Press `ctrl + o` to write out (save) the changes, and press `enter` to keep the same file name when prompted. You should see "wrote lines" at the bottom of the screen.
10. Press `ctrl + x` to exit the _nano_ text editor. There should be no prompt since you just saved the changes.

### Python Scripts

*"pulsePython_Output"* will pulse _Python_Output_ on module 0, digital output channel 22, using the Manage REST API.
* `python pulsePython_Output.py`    will pulse the output twenty-two times.

*"writePython_Output"* will toggle _Python_Output_ on module 0, digital output channel 22, using the Manage REST API.
* `python writePython_Output.py on`    will turn the output on.
* `python writePython_Output.py off`    will turn the output off.

*"readtc"* returns the decimal value of analog input channel 0, module 2, which should have a thermocouple installed, using the Manage REST API.
* `python readtc.py`    will read the input channel and output the result.

*"restreaddigmodch"* returns the state of the given module and channel: two required parameters for module and channel number using the Manage API.
* `python restreaddigmodch.py 0 1`    will read the digital state of localhost module 0, channel 1, and output the result.

*"restwritedigmodch0or1"* sets the state of the given module and channel: three required parameters for module number, channel number, and state 1 or 0 using the Manage API.
* `python restwritedigmodch0or1.py 0 1 1`    will write the digital state of localhost module 0, channel 1 to be = 1 (on/true) and attempt confirmation.

*"writePython_Var"* will write the given value to the _Python_Var_ int32 variable using the PAC Control REST API.
* `python writePython_Var.py 22`    will write 22 to the variable.

*"readLPTvar"* returns the decimal value of PAC Control float variable "_Presure_Transducer_1_" using the PAC Control REST API.
